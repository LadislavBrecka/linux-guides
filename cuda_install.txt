First, we need to check which versions of CUDA and CUDNN are supported by tensorflow.
We cam check it on site:  https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu

In October 2022, Tensorflow supports only CUDA 11.2 and CUDNN 8.1 -> so we need to install these versions.

I have combined 2 articles together:
	https://askubuntu.com/a/1288405
	https://yakhyo.medium.com/cuda-11-2-installation-on-ubuntu-20-04-e83f7561ccc1

From first'askubuntu' I took step with installing NVIDIA driver as standalone and not with CUDA included one.
But the version of CUDA he is installing is newer, so we need to know which driver do we need for CUDA 11.2 
Exactly that information is in second article, where he is installing CUDA 11.2 but with another steps.
So I took version info's and proceed with steps in 'askubuntu' answer. When NVIDIA Driver is sucesfully 
instaled, I proceed with installation of CUDA with version described in 'yakhyo'.
Installation of CUDNN is then done by steps in 'yakhyo' article. So, the exact steps which I did are:



- sudo apt-get purge nvidia*     		// remove previous nvidia drivers
- sudo apt-get autoremove  			
- sudo apt install nvidia-driver-460		// install driver with correct version for CUDA 11.2

Now, we have installed correct NVIDIA driver for CUDA 11.2 (as it is described in 'yakhyo' link).
Next step will be to install CUDA 11.2 .

- wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/11.2.0/local_installers/cuda_11.2.0_460.27.04_linux.run 
- sudo sh cuda_11.2.0_460.27.04_linux.run

If you get the following, just choose Continue: (we have installed driver because we want separate driver from the one
included in CUDA installation file).

Then press the down arrow to Install. Press Enter then wait for installation to complete.

After the installation is complete add the following to the bottom of your ~/.profile or add it to the /etc/profile.d/cuda.sh file which you might have to create for all users (global):

# set PATH for cuda 11.2 installation
if [ -d "/usr/local/cuda-11.2/bin/" ]; then
    export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.2/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.2/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
fi

Next, we need to download correct version of CUDNN, which is 8.1 for CUDA 11.2.
Go to site https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn and download correct version (select Linux x86_64 TAR file).
Then:

- tar -xzvf cudnn-11.2-linux-x64-v8.1.0.53.tgz
- sudo cp cuda/include/cudnn*.h /usr/local/cuda-11.2/include
- sudo cp cuda/lib64/libcudnn* /usr/local/cuda-11.2/lib64
- sudo chmod a+r /usr/local/cuda-11.2/include/cudnn*.h /usr/local/cuda-11.2/lib64/libcudnn*

I recommend now to reboot the system for the changes to take effect.
